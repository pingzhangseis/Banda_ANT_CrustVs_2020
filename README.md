# Banda_ANT_CrustVs_2020
A 3-D crustal Vs model of Banda Arc collision zone based on ambient noise tomography (ANT), derived by Zhang and Miller, (2020).

# Model Summary
Banda_ANT_CrustVs_2020 is based on ambient noise tomography with ~4-year continuous data from a temporary seismic deployment consisting of 30 broadband stations (YS array; Miller, 2014) deployed in the Timor-Leste and Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) region of Indonesia (Miller et al., 2016) together with three permennant stations of GE network (GEOFON Data Center, 1993) in the immediate vicinity.

# Model Descriptions:
Name(Model ID): Banda_ANT_CrustVs_2020;
Type: 3-D Tomography Earth Model;
Subtype: Shear wave velocity (km/s);
Year: 2020;
Area: Banda Arc Region (latitude is 7.5-11.25 SOUTH and longitude is 117.5-128.5 EAST, interval is 0.25 degree);
Depth Coverage: 0-65 km (best solution is in the upper 50 km);

Model resolution description: Checkerboard tests with checker size of 0.75 by 0.75 degree show that the Vs model in upper 50 km can be reasonably resolved in regions where data coverage is dense with lateral resolution of ~60-80 km, although varying degrees of smearing are observed. Please refer to Zhang and Miller, GRL, (2020) for more details.
